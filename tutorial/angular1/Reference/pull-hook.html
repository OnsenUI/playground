<!-- info

## Pull to refresh

The `<ons-pull-hook>` is used to perform an action when the user pulls down the page. It's a common design pattern in mobile apps.

It is normally put as a direct descendant to the `<ons-page>` element.

```
<ons-page>
  <ons-toolbar>
    ...
  </ons-toolbar>

  <ons-pull-hook></ons-pull-hook>
</ons-page>
```

## Setting the callback

The callback that should be executed when the user pulls the page can be set as an expression with `ng-action` attribute: `<ons-pull-hook ng-action="myController.load($done)">`

This callback will take a `$done` function as an argument that needs to be called when the action is performed. Calling the function will cause the page to snap back into position.

```
app.controller('MyController', function() {
  this.load = function($done) {
    refreshData()
      .then($done);
  };
});
```

## States

The `<ons-pull-hook>` has three different states:

* `initial` - Initial state.
* `preaction` - Will run the callback when released.
* `action` - Currently running the callback.

The element will update its state in `pullHook.state` property so it can be easily accessed by, for example, `ng-switch`:

```
<ons-pull-hook ng-action="page.load($done)" var="pullHook">
  <span ng-switch="pullHookElement.state">
    <span ng-switch-when="initial">Pull down to refresh</span>
    <span ng-switch-when="preaction">Release to refresh</span>
    <span ng-switch-when="action">Loading data...</span>
  </span>
</ons-pull-hook>
```

## Styling with CSS

Another way to change the content or the appearance of the `<ons-pull-hook>` element is to use CSS and attribute selectors.

The element has the attribute `style` which will have the value of the current state:

```
ons-pull-hook[style="initial"] {
  // Write some style for initial state here.
}

...
```

## Customizing the behavior

There are a number of attributes that can be used to configure how the `<ons-pull-hook>` will behave.

The `height` attribute defines how long the component must be pulled before transitioning to the `preaction` state. With the `threshold-height` attribute the component can be configured to transition directly to the `action` state without releasing.

There is also an attribute called `fixed-content` that prevents the page from moving while scrolling.
