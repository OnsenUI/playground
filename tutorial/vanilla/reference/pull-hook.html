<!-- info

## Pull to refresh

The `<ons-pull-hook>` is used to perform an action when the user pulls down the page. It's a common design pattern in mobile apps.

It is normally put as a direct descendant to the `<ons-page>` element.

```
<ons-page>
  <ons-toolbar>
    ...
  </ons-toolbar>

  <ons-pull-hook></ons-pull-hook>
</ons-page>
```

## Setting the callback

To set the callback that should be executed when the user pulls the page you can modify the `actionCallback(callback)` property.

The callback will take a function as an argument that needs to be called when the action is performed. Calling the function will cause the page to snap back into position.

```
var pullHook = document.getElementById('pull-hook');
pullHook.actionCallback = function(done) {
  refreshTheData()
    .then(done);
};
```

## States

The `<ons-pull-hook>` has three different states:

* `initial` - Initial state.
* `preaction` - Will run the callback when released.
* `action` - Currently running the callback.

The element will throw the DOM event `changestate` when it transitions between any of these states.

```
pullHook.addEventListener('changestate', function(event) {
  console.log('Changed to state: ' + event.state);
});
```

Listening to these state changes can be used to change the content of the element to give the user information about what is happening.

## Styling with CSS

Another way to change the content or the appearance of the `<ons-pull-hook>` element is to use CSS and attribute selectors.

The element has the attribute `style` which will have the value of the current state:

```
ons-pull-hook[style="initial"] {
  // Write some style for initial state here.
}

...
```

## Customizing the behavior

There are a number of attributes that can be used to configure how the `<ons-pull-hook>` will behave.

The `height` attribute defines how long the component must be pulled before transitioning to the `preaction` state. With the `threshold-height` attribute the component can be configured to transition directly to the `action` state without releasing.

There is also an attribute called `fixed-content` that prevents the page from moving while scrolling.
