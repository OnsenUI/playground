## React Components

We provide [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components for Onsen UI. React is a great library for building user interfaces and mobile apps.

In this tutorial we will create a simple "Hello, world" example using React and Onsen UI components.

## What is JSX?

If you're not familiar with React you might think that the code is not proper JavaScript and you are right to think that.

React apps are often written in something called [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) which is an extension of the JavaScript language.

JSX can be transformed into proper JavaScript by running a JSX transform.

## JSX continued

Let's take a look at the following JSX statement:

```
var app = <Nav color="blue" />;
```

When converted into JavaScript from JSX it will turn into this:

```
var app = React.createElement(Nav, {color: 'blue'});
```

The JSX transform makes React code a lot cleaner since we don't need to put a lot of `React.createElement` in our code.

## The `Ons` object

The React extension exports an object called `Ons` where all the components are attached. So to create a button you can use the `Ons.Button` component.

```
<Ons.Button>Click me!</Ons.Button>
```

It also contains a bunch of other components such as:

* `Ons.Page`
* `Ons.Toolbar`
* `Ons.Navigator`
* ...and many more.

## Creating a page

To create a page we use the `Ons.Page` component. The toolbar is added with the `Ons.Toolbar` component.

```
<Ons.Page>
  <Ons.Toolbar>
    <div className="center">Title</div>
  </Ons.Toolbar>
</Ons.Page>
```

The toolbar is divided into three sections defined by the `left`, `center` and `right` classes. In React the `className` prop is used instead of `class` for assigning classes.

## Defining event handlers

In React some event handlers are exposed as props. One of those is the `onClick` prop which can be used with any component.

```
<Ons.Button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</Ons.Button>
```

When the button is clicked the `this.handleClick` method is called.

## Showing a notification

The `Ons` object contains all the components so it's different from the `ons` object which is provided by the core Onsen UI library.

Just like in normal Onsen UI apps you can show dialogs using the `ons.notification` methods:

```
ons.notification.alert('Hello world!');
```
