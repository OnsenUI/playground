<!-- info

## Pull to refresh

The `VOnsPullHook` component is used to add a *pull to refresh* functionality to a page. It can let the user refresh a page or load the latest data.

The `VOnsPullHook` component has three different states: `initial`, `preaction` and `action`. It starts in the `initial` state. When it's pulled down below its height it will transition into the `preaction` state. If it's released in `initial` state it will just bounce back. If it's released in the `preaction` state,  it will go into `action` state.

Every time the state changes the, a `changestate` event is fired.

Through the `action` prop it is possible to provide a handler that runs when the component reaches "action" state. This handler gets a `done` function as a parameter that must be called when the action is finished, thus returning to the `initial` state.
